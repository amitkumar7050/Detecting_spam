# Detecting_spam
Spam messages are unsolicited or unwanted messages/emails sent in bulk to users. Most messaging/emailing services automatically detect these messages as spam to prevent inboxes from being flooded. These messages are typically promotional and unusual. Therefore, we can create machine learning/deep learning models to detect spam messages. We will create a spam detector using TensorFlow; we need to classify the texts as 'Spam' or 'Ham.' This means that spam detection is a text classification problem. Therefore, we will conduct exploratory data analysis on our dataset and build a text classification model.
